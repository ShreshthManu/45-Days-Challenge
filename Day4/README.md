# Skills Management with JavaScript

✅ **Day X Completed – Skills Data Handling in JavaScript!**

As part of the **#45DaysChallenge** guided by *Aldrin Menon*, I worked on manipulating an array of skills with JavaScript to perform various operations like formatting, filtering, sorting, and grouping.

---

## 🚀 What I Built / Did:
- Created a `skills` array containing skill name, proficiency, and category  
- Grouped skills by category using `reduce()`  
- Formatted skills into readable strings using `map()`  
- Filtered out only **Advanced** skills  
- Sorted skills alphabetically by name  
- Added years of experience to specific skills  
- Connected the script with an HTML page (`app.js` linked inside `index.html`)  

---

## 📚 What I Learned:
- Using **`reduce()`** for grouping objects in an array  
- Difference between **`map()`**, **`filter()`**, and **`sort()`**  
- How to extend objects dynamically using the spread operator (`...skill`)  
- Linking external JS files inside HTML with `<script src="app.js"></script>`  

---

## ▶️ Run the Project

1. Create two files:  
   - `app.js` → Paste the JavaScript code  
   - `index.html` → Paste the HTML structure  

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to load the script.  

3. Open **Console** (`F12` → Console tab) to see outputs:  
   - Formatted skills list  
   - Advanced skills only  
   - Sorted skills by name  
   - Skills with added experience  
   - Grouped skills by category
