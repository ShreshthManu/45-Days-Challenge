# Day 7 – Express.js Basic API Setup

✅ **Day 7 Completed – Express.js Basic API Setup!**

As part of the **#45DaysChallenge** guided by *Aldrin Menon* I built a simple Express.js server with basic routes.

---

## 🚀 What I Built / Did:
- Initialized an Express.js application  
- Created a root route (`/`) serving a welcome message  
- Built an API route (`/api`) returning JSON response  

---

## 📚 What I Learned:
- Setting up an Express.js server from scratch  
- Difference between `res.send()` and `res.json()`  
- Running and testing APIs on `http://localhost:3000`  

---

## ▶️ Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install express
2. Run the server
    ```bash
    node index.js
3. Visit in browser
    '''bash
    Root: http://localhost:3000/
    API: http://localhost:3000/api
