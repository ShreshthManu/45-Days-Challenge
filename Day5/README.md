# Business Card & Counter App with JavaScript

✅ **Day 5 Completed – Business Card & Counter Projects!**

As part of the **#45DaysChallenge** guided by *Aldrin Menon*, I built two interactive frontend projects – a **Personal Business Card webpage** with Dark/Light theme toggle and a **Counter app** with increment, decrement, and reset functionality.

---

## 🚀 What I Built / Did:
- Designed a **Business Card webpage** with profile image, description, and contact links  
- Implemented **Dark Mode / Light Mode** toggle using JavaScript  
- Built a **Counter app** with Increase, Decrease, and Reset buttons  
- Added hover effects, responsive layout, and clean UI styling  

---

## 📚 What I Learned:
- How to dynamically switch themes using **`classList.toggle()`**  
- Updating DOM elements with **`innerText`** for live counters  
- Organizing reusable CSS styles for better UI/UX  
- Combining multiple small projects in the same directory structure
