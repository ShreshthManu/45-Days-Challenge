# 📜 Day 6 – Quote Generator with API, Share & Copy Features

✅ **Day 6 Completed – Quote Generator Project!**

As part of the **#45DaysChallenge** guided by *Aldrin Menon*, I built a Quote Generator that fetches quotes dynamically from an API with category filtering, fallback dummy quotes, and integrated sharing features.  

---

## 🚀 What I Built / Did:
- Built a **Quote Generator** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Fetched random quotes from **Quotable API** (with category filter support)  
- Added **Loader Animation** while fetching quotes  
- Implemented **fallback dummy quotes** when API fails  
- Integrated **Copy to Clipboard** functionality  
- Added **Social Media Sharing** (Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp)  
- Designed a **responsive UI** with gradient background and styled buttons

## 📚 What I Learned:
- Using **Fetch API** with async/await and error handling  
- Handling **API fallback** with dummy data when API request fails  
- Creating a **loading spinner animation** with CSS  
- Dynamically updating **share links** for social platforms  
- Copying text programmatically with **Clipboard API**  
- Improving UX with **cache control & avoiding duplicate quotes**
